## Components

- Arduino Nano
- MAX30102
- LCD 16*2
- Potentiometer 10K

## Features

- **Real-time Heart Rate Monitoring**: The project enables users to monitor their heart rate in real-time, providing immediate feedback on their cardiovascular health status.
- **SpO2 Measurement**: The application also measures the blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2), which indicates the oxygen levels in the bloodstream. This feature helps users assess their respiratory well-being.

## Usage

To get started with the Heart Rate and SpO2 Measurements Project, follow these steps:

1. Turn on the device.
2. Put your finger on the sensor.
3. Wait a while then the heart rate and SpO2 measurments will appear on the LCD screen.

## Configuration

The Heart Rate and SpO2 Measurements Project provides configuration options for users to personalize their experience. These options may include:

- **Threshold Customization**: Adjust the heart rate and SpO2 thresholds according to individual preferences or medical recommendations.
- **Measurement Interval**: Set the frequency of heart rate and SpO2 measurements, determining how often the application records readings.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Calibrate the heart rate and SpO2 sensor for accurate measurements based on personal factors or environmental conditions.
